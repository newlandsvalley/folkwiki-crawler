# FolkWiki Crawler

This is an experiment.  Apparently folkwiki possesses its own crawler so this repository won't really be necessary.

I was hoping to be able to use this in order to scrape the [FolkWiki](http://www.folkwiki.se/) website and to dump its tunes so as to make them available to AI-powered search apps such as [Tunepal](https://tunepal.org/index.html#!/record) and [FolkFriend](https://folkfriend.app/).
